🎓 GPA Calculator Website

Welcome to my GPA Calculator project — a complete, professional-grade website 🌐 where you can calculate your GPA 📚 easily and keep track of your academic progress. I made this project using Python 🐍 (for the backend), along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The entire project is fully functional, clean, and designed for a smooth user experience ✨.

💎 What makes this special?

Unlike typical projects, I didn’t use frameworks like Flask or Django 🚫. Instead, I built a custom backend using Python’s built-in features ⚙️ to handle all data operations. This means it’s lightweight, fast, and educational — perfect for students 🎓, developers 👨‍💻, or anyone who wants a GPA calculator that actually works ✅.

🚀 Features:

➕ Add multiple courses with their credit hours and grades
📈 See your GPA calculated instantly and clearly
💾 Save your GPA history in a database
📂 View or 🗑️ clear your GPA history whenever you want
🎨 Clean and modern design that works on desktop browsers 🖥️
⚡ No need to install anything extra — just Python, that’s it

🖥️ How to Run It:

1️⃣ Download the project folder or clone the repository from my GitHub
2️⃣ Open your terminal or command prompt and run this command:

python app.py

3️⃣ After that, open the index.html file in your browser 🌐
4️⃣ Start adding courses and calculate your GPA — that’s it 🎉

🛠️ What I Used:

Frontend: HTML 📝, CSS 🎨, JavaScript ⚙️
Backend: Python 🐍 (Custom HTTP Server)
Database: SQLite 🗄️ (simple, fast, lightweight)

💡 Why I Made This:

I wanted to create something practical and helpful ✅, especially for students like me who constantly need to calculate their GPA during semesters 📅. Instead of going to different websites every time, now I have my own GPA calculator — and you can use it too! 🙌
